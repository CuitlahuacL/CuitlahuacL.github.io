* Lab 7

    One of my favorite labs has to be lab (7) for the whole theme of the code we were doing, Black Jack. As a kid, I fell in love with the game itself but seeing the game as a code and the behind the scenes for how the game works and how the legistics of win lose situations go is what motivated me to work. Lab (7) (Part-1) spoke in regards to how the win/lose factors played a part, in most games where it was a Hi and Low guessing game contributing to letting you explore the idea of restricted chances. Where a player had a limited of guesses until you had to write your code to stop the other player from continuing if they couldn't guess your hidden number. And then in Lab (7) (Part-2) I had a fun time writing the code for which if a player played my game, they would be playing actual blackjack against a dealer (the code itself).

    Another one of my favorite labs has to be Lab (5), not because it was a hard lab or challenged me academically. But the lab itself was just something fun that you could do with code which is something that I believe contributes to people liking it and if I could show people that code isn't always scary.That you could have fun making a code where all you do is fill in the blank and if it is correct, you'll get a 0 which means the input was correct. However; if the code wasnt correct then a error message would print.

    Another worthy mention of my liking to this code has to be Lab (1). This code I feel was the journey to something far beyond anything that could have been presented to me. The reason I feel so happy about having gotten the Hello World project lab as my first lab was because it was interesting to see how I myself could interact with code and have it interact back with me. Which is something that plays a vital part/role in the development of a liking to code. And as an add-on, this was just the start to greatness within my coding skills.
